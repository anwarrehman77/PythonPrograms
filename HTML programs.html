<h1>Pokemon GO</h1><br />

    <div class= "info"><h2>How to play</h2></div>
    <p>Hey guys, you must know about the new game pokemon go!!!!
     So if you know how to play skip this paragragh.
     So sometimes you may wonder "How do I move my avatar"
     well it's simple move in the real world. Maybe you might not know how to catch a pokemon all you need to do is tap on the pokemon that you want to catch and swipe the pokeball at the pokemon and hope for the best or just use a better ball or even just use a razz berry. If you are wondering how to battle just keep tapping the screen but when the bar is full hold the screen then let go and unleash your pokemon's power!!! If you get an egg and you want to incubate it go to the pokemon screen and swipe left to the egg screen tap the egg you to incubate, then press the "Start Incubation" button. To put your Pokemon in a gym press the button with a pokeball and a plus sign get out there and battle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    </p>

    <h2>Easter Egg</h2>
    <p>When you start the game walk away from the starter pokemon at least four times and pikachu should be there.</p>

    <h2>Glitches</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Name your evee Rainer, Sparkey or Pyro and evolve your evee into the aproprriate name!</li>
        <li>If you download fake GPS you type in where you want the game to think you are at. P.S. I am not responsible for possible banning and if you are banned for the fake GPS glitch it's temporary.
        <li>If you use an insence and it's getting pretty low you can go to clock and set an alarm to ealier on and acording to the internet you should get more time on your insence.</li>
